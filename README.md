This template showcases a [ReAct agent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629) implemented using [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph), extended with a **Claude-style "think" tool** that enables structured internal reasoning before taking any action‚Äîideal for complex multi-step workflows and policy-compliant environments.

## üöÄ Features

- üß† **`think` Tool**: Forces the agent to reflect before acting, logging structured reasoning steps.
- üîÅ **ReAct Agent Loop**: Reason ‚Üí Act ‚Üí Observe ‚Üí Repeat.
- üîå **Pluggable Tooling**: Easily integrate new tools (e.g., search, APIs).
- üìö **Optimized Prompting**: Includes domain-style guidance for better decision-making.
- üß© **LangGraph Studio Ready**: Visualize and edit the graph in-browser.

## üîç What‚Äôs New

This fork adds a Claude-inspired `think` tool with the following logic:

```python
def think(thought: str, config: Annotated[RunnableConfig, InjectedToolArg]) -> str:
    """Think tool for structured intermediate reasoning before actions."""
```

Used as a scratchpad to:
- List applicable rules
- Check required information
- Validate planned actions
- Reflect on tool outputs

üìå Prompt template included in `THINK_PROMPT`, used dynamically with `Configuration`.

## üìà Use Cases

- Complex workflows (e.g., booking, support, compliance)
- Long tool-call chains needing internal verification
- Reasoning transparency and debuggability
- Agents operating in policy-heavy domains (e.g., airline, finance, legal)

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

1. Clone the repo  
2. Create a `.env` file from `.env.example`
3. Install all requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Add your API keys (OpenAI, Tavily)
5. Run in LangGraph Studio

## üß∞ Tools Configuration

You can modify the tool list in `src/agent/tools.py`:

```python
TOOLS: List[Callable[..., Any]] = [search, think]
```

And the system prompt logic in `src/agent/prompts.py`.

## ‚úÖ Development Tips

- Use hot reload in LangGraph Studio
- Add custom nodes for internal logging or external validation
- Extend `think()` to support domain-specific policies or memory
